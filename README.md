# react-pgn-viewer
React component that parses pgn html elements to interactive pgn viewers.

## NOTE

This is a major Work-in-Progress. There is currently no npm version available and the first versions will most likely break.

## Installation

## Usage

```
render() {
  return (
    <PgnViewer innerHTML>
      {'<pgn>1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4'</pgn>}
    </PgnViewer
    )
}
```

This icons use font-awesome 4. If you aren't already using that, simply put the cdn in the head of your html

```
<link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css" rel="stylesheet"
